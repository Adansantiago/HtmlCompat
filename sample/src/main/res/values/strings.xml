        <h1>HtmlCompat</h1>

        <h2>Why?</h2>

        <p>
        Nougat introduced vast improvements to the <tt>Html</tt> class for converting HTML to spannables.
        Unfortunately, these new features lay within the Android SDK itself. This means that the behavior
        in which HTML is converted is subject to the version of Android that the user is running.
        </p>

        <p>
        HtmlCompat attempts to address this problem by providing developers with a compatibility library.
        All logic for converting HTML is enclosed within this library and can be bundled within an app.
        This means that the presentation is agnostic to the version of Android of the device.
        </p>

        <h3>What\'t supported?</h3>

        <p>
        All the latest functionality from the current <tt>Html</tt> for Android Nougat is included in this
        library. While this may continue to be improved in the future, currently, the following tags are
        supported out of the box:
        </p>

        <ul>
        <li><tt>&lt;br&gt;</tt></li>
        </ul>
